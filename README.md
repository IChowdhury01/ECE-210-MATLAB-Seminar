Problem sets for ECE-210: MATLAB Seminar

## Assignment Descriptions

- **Problem Set 1:** Variables, operations, vectors, and matrices
- **Problem Set 2:** Vectorization vs for-loops
- **Problem Set 3:** Vector/matrix manipulation
- **Problem Set 5:** Classes and Fisherisis dataset.
- **Problem Set 6:** Transfer functions and Z-transform
- **Problem Set 7:** Butterworth, chebychev, and elliptic filters
- **Problem Set 9:** BPSK/AWGN simulations, bit error rate, and probability mass functions

Note: This course required only a majority of assigned problem sets to be completed. Incomplete problem sets were not included.


## Course Description
A weekly hands-on, interactive seminar that introduces students to MATLAB, in general, and the Signal Processing Toolbox in particular. Students explore scientific computation and scientific visualization with MATLAB. Concepts of signal processing and system analysis that are presented in ECE 111 or other introductory courses on the subject are reinforced through a variety of demonstrations and exercises. It is strongly encouraged for students taking a first course in signals and systems, or for students expecting to use MATLAB in projects or courses.
